            <h1>Introduction</h1>
            <p>
                During this work term, I worked as a Data Analyst Co-op at RBC, one of Canada's largest banks. This opportunity helped me understand how data is used in real-world financial services and gave me a chance to apply what I've learned in school to real projects. I worked on tasks related to wire transfers, employee attrition, Tableau reporting, and ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) processes. I also had the chance to improve my technical skills in Python, SQL, and tools like Selenium.
                This report summarizes the work I did, what I learned, and how the experience helped me grow as a student and future data professional.
            </p>
            <h1>Company Overview</h1>
            <p>
                RBC is one of the biggest financial institutions in Canada. It provides banking, investment, insurance, and wealth management services. RBC uses a lot of data to make decisions, support clients, and improve operations. As a Data Analyst Co-op, I worked in a team that handled various datasets and worked with tools to clean, process, and visualize data.
            </p>
            <h1>Role and Responsibilities</h1>
            <p>My role as a Data Analyst Co-op involved the following tasks:</p>
            <h2>ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) Work</h2>
            <p>
                One of my main responsibilities was creating and managing ETL pipelines using Python and SQL Server. I worked with datasets related to wire transfers and employee attrition. I learned how to:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Connect to databases</li>
                <li>Extract raw data</li>
                <li>Clean and transform data into usable formats</li>
                <li>Load the data into SQL Server tables</li>
            </ul>
            <p>These ETL pipelines were important for creating dashboards and reports used by different teams at RBC.</p>
            <h2>Automation with Python and Selenium</h2>
            <p>I also helped with automation tasks using Python. One project involved using Selenium, a browser automation tool, to automatically update reports and process records that would normally take a lot of time manually. This helped our team and other departments save time and reduce errors.</p>
            <h2>Working with Tableau</h2>
            <p>I worked on Tableau dashboards by analyzing metadata like workbook names, view names, and click counts. I used this information to measure dashboard usage and help teams understand which views were most valuable. This work helped make our dashboards more useful and easier to manage.</p>
            <h2>Data Lineage Project</h2>
            <p>I helped with a data lineage project, which involved mapping out relationships between SQL tables, Tableau dashboards, Python scripts, and SAS files. The goal was to show how data flows across systems. I used Python to build data structures and explored ways to visualize these connections using D3.js, a JavaScript library for data visualization.</p>
            <h2>Collaboration and Communication</h2>
            <p>I worked closely with my manager and other team members. We had regular meetings to go over progress, plan new work, and share updates. I also had 1-on-1 meetings with my manager to get feedback and talk about my goals.</p>
            <h1>Tools and Technologies Used</h1>
            <p>
                During the term, I got hands-on experience with many different tools:
            </p>
               <ul>
                <li>Python - for scripting, automation, data processing</li>
                <li>SQL Server - for managing and querying structured data</li>
                <li>Selenium - for automating web tasks and repetitive updates</li>
                <li>Tableau - for data visualization and dashboard analysis</li>
                <li>D3.js - for interactive data visualizations</li>
                <li>Git/GitHub - for version control and collaboration</li>
                <li>Excel - for quick data checks and sharing with other teams</li>
                <li>Teradata, Hive/Hadoop - for retrieving data from RBC's enterprise data systems</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                These tools helped me work on different kinds of data projects and improved my technical confidence.
            </p>
            <h1>Challenges and Solutions</h1>
            <p>One challenge I faced was working with unfamiliar datasets and systems. For example, learning how RBC stores data in their Enterprise Data Warehouse (EDW) and Enterprise Data Lake (EDL) was new for me. I overcame this by asking questions, reading documentation, and breaking down tasks into small steps.</p>
            <p>Another challenge was automating processes that involved complex web pages. Using Selenium helped, but it took trial and error to get it working reliably. I learned how to use debugging tools and write better code through this experience.</p>
            <h1>Conclusion</h1>
            <p>
                My co-op term at RBC was a great experience. I learned a lot, gained practical skills, and got to work with amazing people. The projects I worked on helped me understand how data plays a key role in banking, and the feedback I received helped me grow.
            </p>
            <p>
                This experience has confirmed that I want to keep learning more about data science and analytics. I'm excited to apply what I've learned in future courses and jobs.
