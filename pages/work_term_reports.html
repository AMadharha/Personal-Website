                    <h1>Introduction</h1>
                    <hr>
                    <p>
                        For my first work term, I had the amazing opportunity to work at ATS - a leader in the industrial automation space. During my first four months, I have gained many skills that will aid me in my future. I have improved my technical knowledge, business knowledge, and collaborative skills. In this report, I will be explaining some of the major projects and initiatives I have been apart of and my plans for my future at ATS.
                    </p>

                    </div>
                    <p>
                        Before I explain some of the specific responsibilities I've had, I will first explain some of the major technologies I used during my first four months at ATS. As a Data Analyst, it's it important that I am comfortable with Microsoft Excel as the majority of the data I am working with is delievered in Excel spreadsheets. I was able to greatly improve my understanding of Excel at ATS due to how common it was to work with it.
                    </p><br>
                    <p>
                        Besides Excel, another technology I commonly used was Salesforce. My team plays a major role in creating reports and dashboards in Salesforce for other teams to utilize, meaning it was crucial that I was familiar with how to create these reports and dashboards. Additionally, we need to use Salesforce to pull data to analyze so my skills with the technology improved drastically.
                    </p><br>
                    <p>
                        Another technology I used was Visio. I was commonly tasked with creating Visio's to visually represent some of the things I was working on. In order to easily understand some of the processes and to document work, I used Visio and gained a comfortable familiarity with the app.
                    </p>
                    <h1>Kaizan</h1>
                    <hr>
                    <p>
                        One of the first things I participated in at ATS was a Kaizan. A Kaizan is where a group of employees come together to change something about the business with the goal being continuous improvement. The Kaizan I was involved in was to evaluate major processes throughout the business to identify room for automation/optimization.
                    </p><br>
                    <p>
                        During this Kaizan, I learned a lot about how ATS as a business functions. I learned the relationship between a lot of the different teams in the organization which really helped when starting out. The things I learned weren't specific to ATS however, there was valuable general information about business that I can take with me to wherever I work in the future.
                    </p><br>
                    <p>
                        My specific responsibility at this Kaizan was to document the work using Visio. There was a lot of work being done using sticky notes on a brown sheet to represent reformed business processes. If the work was needed after the Kaizan, it would be much more accessible and understandable digitally. I utilized Visio to digitize the hardcopies so that all the work in the Kaizan was documented and can be used afterwards.

                    <h1>Customer Segmentation</h1>
                    <hr>
                    <p>
                        A major project I was involved in was Customer Segmentation. Customer segmentation is the process of dividing a company's customer base into distinct groups based on certain characteristics so that marketing strategies can be tailored to each specific group. We had a goal to push customer segmentation forward within the business.
                    </p>
                    <h2>Customer Segmentation Scorecards</h2>
                    <p>
                        Through divising a plan on how to implement customer segmentation into the business, the customer segmentation scorecards were created. They consisted of multiple questions related to our customers: their proximity, automation competency, average spend with ATS, etc. Each scorecard was a separate Excel file containing the data.
                    </p><br>
                    <p>
                        I was tasked with aggregating the data so it can be easily utilized in analysis. After the aggregation, I created potential questions that we could get answers to using this data. An example question would look like "how does the customers average spend with ATS corrlate with their automation competency?". After creating some sample questions, I utilized Excel to create charts and graphs in attempts to answer some of these important questions. This aggregation was used in a presentation to stakeholders in the business.
                    </p>
                    <h2>Customer Financial Data</h2>
                    <p>
                        Another aspect to customer segmentation was collection our customer's financial data. I was tasked with looking through public financial reports belonging to our customers to collect data on their financial position. The main facts we were looking for were their revenue and profit, comparing these facts year-to-year. This was to see if we can find insight into the financial growth of our customers, to see if we can find an opportunity for more capital investment into ATS.
                    </p>
                    <h1>Future Goals</h1>
                    <hr>
                    <div class="image-container">
                        <img src="../images/python.png" alt="Python Logo">

                    </div>
                    <p>
                        I want to expland some of the technologies I am using to make my work more efficient. I believe I can utilize Python to automate and create scripts that will help me create aggregations effectively. I also want to learn Tableau as it is a powerful data visualization tool. Expanding the technologies I am using will also align some of my work with my Computer Science degree.
                    </p><br>
                    <p>
                        My next work term is also at ATS, so I hope I can accomplish these goals during the next 4 months!
                    </p>
                    <h1>Conclusion</h1>
                    <hr>
                    <p>
                        In reflection, my tenure at ATS has been an incredibly enriching and transformative experience. Not only have I been able to apply my academic knowledge to real-world scenarios, but I've also grown both technically and interpersonally.
