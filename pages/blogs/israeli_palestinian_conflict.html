            <h1 id="title">The Israeli-Palestinian Conflict</h1>
            <hr>
            <p>
                Recently, you must have heard about some of the events happening in the Middle East, specifically between Israel and Palestine. The conflict has been the main topic covered in the media for the last week or so, and if you have minimal knowledge about the conflict it can seem difficult to approach - atleast that's how I felt. I thought the conflict went back thousands of years becuase of religious differences, and so I felt that I wouldn't ever be able to grasp the full story of what's going on. If you feel similiarly, I think reading this will help tremoundously in gaining a historical and recent understanding of the situation. 
            </p>
           
            <h1>The Empires!</h1>
            <hr>
            <p>
                Let's start with a little bit of history. A common misunderstanding is that this conflict starts centuries in the past. I myself thought the same. While religious differences play a part, this is mainly a battle rooted in nationalism.
            </p>
            <h2>The Ottoman Empire (1299 - 1922)</h2>
            <p>
                During the late 19th century, the current Israel-Palestine land was ruled over by the Ottoman Empire. The area inhabited members of the big three religions, with 87% Muslim, 10% Christian, and 3% Jewish. It was a peaceful place where people of differnt religious faiths lived together.
            </p>
            <h2>The Austro-Hungarian Empire (1867 - 1918)</h2>
            <p>
                The Austro-Hungarian Empire ruled over land that is now known as Central and Eastern Europe (countries like Austria, Hungary, Czech Reubpiblic, Slovakia, etc.). In the late 19th century, nationalism was on the rise! At least 10 different nations in this empire all wanted their own state. Within this empire lived <b>Theodor Herzl (1860 - 1904)</b>, someone who hoped that Jews could assimilate into European nations. However, after his personal experiences with anti-semitism, issues with assimiliation and identity, and the rise of nationalism - he came to the conclusions that the Jewish people needed to leave Europe and settle in their own state. This concept of Jewish nationalism is known as <b>Zionism</b>.
            </p>
            <h1>World War I (1914 - 1918)</h1>
            <hr>
            <p>
                When World War I broke out in 1914, the British aimed to weaken and dismantle the Ottoman Empire, and so they sought local allies.
            </p>
            <h2>British Dealings with the Meccans (Arab Revolt):</h2>
            <p>
                The Hashemite Sharif Hussein of Mecca, a descendant of the Prophet Muhammad, was approached by the British. They promised him support in establishing an independent Arab kingdom in exchange for his help in leading an Arab revolt against the Ottoman. The Arab Revolt, initiated in 1916 with British backing, significantly distracted and weakened the Ottoman forces.
            </p>
            <h2>Balfour Declaration (1917)</h2>
            <p>
                The British had another card up their sleeve. They wanted to gain the support of the global Jewish community to maintain and boost morale for the war effort. The Balfour Declaration stated that the British government favored "the establishment in Palestine of a national home for the Jewish people".
            </p>
            <h2>Sykes-Picot Agreement (1916)</h2>
            <p>
                The British and the French made an agreement to carve up the Middle East into British and French spheres of influence once the Ottoman Empire was defeated. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Starting to see the problem here? If Palestine was promised to the Meccans, to the Zionists, and themselves, who would get the land in the end?
            </p>
            </p>
            <h1>British Mandate of Palestine (1920 - 1948)</h1>
            <hr>
            <p>
                The British Mandate for Palestine was officially ratified by the League of Nations in 1922. The territory covered by this mandate is roughly what is today Israel, the West Bank, and Gaza Strip.
            </p>
            <h2>Jewish Immigration and Land Purchases</h2>
            <p>
                During the mandate period, the British allowed and facilitated Jewish immigration and land purchases. This was in line with the objectives of the Zionist movement, which sought a homeland for the Jewish people in Palestine. The Jewish population grew from about 56,000 in 1922 to about 630,000 by 1947.
            </p>
            <h2>Arab Revolt (1936 - 1939)</h2>
            <p>
                The Arab majority viewed the growing Jewish presence and the intent of establishing a "national home" as a direct threat to their national aspirations and rights. Throughout the 1920s and 1930s, tensions escalated with outbreaks of violence between Arabs and Jews. Discontent with British rule and rising tensions due to Jewish immigration led to the Arab Revolt. The revolt was met with a severe British crackdown, and many Arab leaders were arrested or exiled.
            </p>
            <h2>White Paper of 1939</h2>
            <p>
                In response to the Arab Revolt and recognizing the rising tensions, the British goverment issued the White Paper of 1939. This document sought to limit immigration and land purchases, proposing an independent Palestine governed by both Arabs and Jews within 10 years. The Jewish community, particuarly the Zionist leadership, was deeply opposed to the White Paper, as it seemed to reverse many of the promises of the Balfour Declaration.
            </p>
            <h2>World War II and the Holocaust</h2>
            <p>
                The horrors of the Holocaust increased global sympathy for Europe's Jews and fueled calls for a Jewish state. Illegal Jewish immigration to Palestine increased during and after the war.
            </p>
            <h2>The End of the Mandate</h2>
            <p>
                After the war, the Jewish underground groups launching attacks against British forces and Arab groups, aiming to push the British out and establish a Jewish state. In 1947, exhausted by World War II and unable to find a solution to the ongoing conflict between Jewish and Arab communities, Britain referred the Palestine issue to the United Nations. The United Nations proposed dividing Palestine into separate Jewish and Arach states. The Jewish leadership accepted the plan, but the Arab leadership rejected it. Britain formally ended its mandate on May 14, 1948. On the same day, the Jewish leadership declared the establishment of the State of Israel.
            </p>
            <p>
                After the mandate, there are some events worth mentioning, but I won't be going into detail. There was the <b>Suez Crisis (1956)</b>, where Israel, Britian, and France invaded the Sinai Peninsula, leading to a brief war in Egypt. The <b>Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) (1964)</b> was established with the goal of liberating Palestine through armed struggle. The <b>Six-Day War (1967)</b> was a swift conflict between Israel and the neighboring states of Egypt, Jordan, and Syria. This war changed the geopolitical landscape of the MIddle East and set the stage for future conflicts.
            </p>
            <h1>Intifada's</h1>
            <hr>
            <h2>First Intifada</h2>
            <p>
                Widespread frustration among Palestinians in the occupied territories (West Bank and Gaza Strip) over Israeli military and settlements, combined with political tensions, culminated in an upspring. The Intifada brought International attention to the Palestinians and made clear the need for a political solution. During this time, the group <b>Hamas</b> was formed and called for the establishment of an Islamic state in all of historic Palestine (which includes present-day Israel). It eventually led both sides to the negotiating table, resulting in the Oslo Accords.
            </p>
            <h2>Oslo Accords</h2>
            <p>
                Secret negotiations between the PLO and Israel, facilitated by Norway, led to the Oslo Accords, a series of agreements aimed at addressing the ongoing conflict. Some key points:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Mutual Recognition: The PLO recognized Israel's right to exist in peace, while Israel recogninzed the PLO as the representative of the Palestinian people.</li>
                <li>Started Israeli withdrawl from parts of the West Bank and Gaza and the establishment of the Palestinian Authority (PA) to govern these areas.</li>
                <li>The contentious issues like Jerusalem, refugees, settlements, and borders were set aside for "final status" talks.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Despite the initial optimism, implementation was fraught with challenged, and both sides accused the other of not fulfilling obligations.
            </p>
            <h2>Second Intifada (2000 - 2005)</h2>
            <p>
                Triggered by the visit of Israeli opposition leader Ariel Sharon to the Temple Mount in Septemeber 2000 was the starting point that led to violent clashes. This uprising was more militarized and deadly than the First Intifada. It involved suicide bombings, shootings, and various other forms of attacks by Palestinians and military operations, airstrikes, and targeted assassiations by Israel. The trust between Israelis and Palestinians was severly eroded, leading to a decline in peace efforts. Israel began the construction of the West Bank barrier, which was claimed to be for security reasons, but which Palestinians viewed as a land grab.
            </p>
            <h1>The Recent Conflict</h1>
            <hr>
            <h2>Hamas: Background and Origins</h2>
            <p>
                Hamas was founded during the First Intifada. It emerged from the Palestinian branch of the Muslim Brotherhood. Hamas called for the establishment of an Islamic state and did not recognize Israel's right to exist. Hamas's military wing has been involved in various attacks, including suicide bombings rocket attacks, and kidnappings. Hamas is designated as a terrorist organization by Israel, the U.S., the EU, Canada, and other countries. However, it also operates social services like schools, hospitals, and charities in the Gaza Strip.
            </p>
            <h2>Israeli Disengagement from Gaza (2005)</h2>
            <p>
                Israel unilaterally withdrew all of its settlers and military presence from the Gaza Strip. However, Israel maintained control over Gaza's airspace and most border crossings. In the Palestinian legislative elections of 2006, Hamas won a surprise majority. 
            </p>
            <h2>Repeated Conflicts with Israel</h2>
            <p>
                Following the Hamas takeover, Israel and Egypt put in place a blockade on the Gaza Strip, citing security concerns and the need to prevent weapons smuggling. Since 2008, there have been several significant conflicts between Israel and Hamas, characterized by Israeli military operations in Gaza and rocket file from Gaza into Israel. Major operations include:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Operation Case Lead (2008 - 2009)</li>
                <li>Operation Pillar of Defense (2012)</li>
                <li>Operation Protective Edge (2014)</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Tensions and skirmishes between Israel and Hamas have persisted. A major flare-up in 2021 saw significant rocket fire from Gaza and intensive airstrikes, resulting in casualties and infrastructure damage. 
            </p>
            <h2>The Israel - Hamas War (2023)</h2>
            <p>
                Finally, the events of today. An armed conflict between Palestinian militant groups led by Hamas and Israel began on October 7, 2023. The attack began in the morning with a barrage of at least 3,000 rockets launched from the Hamas-controlled Gaza Strip. At least 1,400 Israelis were killed.
            </p>
            <h1>The Problem with Western Politicization</h1>
            <hr>
            <p>
                This ongoing conflict has been horrific for all parties involved. There has been innocent people dying on both sides and a peaceful end to the conflict doesn't seem to be in sight. In the west, I have seen arguments to justify Hamas's actions because they are in support of Palestine's freedom.
            </p>
            <p>
                In my opinion, this isn't a situation where you should be choosing sides. It isn't about who was on the last first or who attacked who first. The truth is that both sides have committed numerous war crimes and have innocent civilians have been killed on both sides. 
            </p>
            <p>
                The only outcome we should push for is peace without persecution along the way. This is an obvious thing to say, but it seems the push for peace sometimes gets lost in people viewing the situation in a political lens, and justfying some of the atrocities that have taken place. People's family and loved ones are actively affected by the conflict, and to see some people saying that one side <i>deserves</i> it is horrible. Some people need to take a break from the internet. Hopefully we can achieve a state where both sides are satisfied with the land arrangements, but year after year this seems to be out of reach - so whats the solution?. I don't know!
