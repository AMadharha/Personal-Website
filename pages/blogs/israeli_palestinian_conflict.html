            <h1 id="title">The Israeli-Palestinian Conflict</h1>
            <hr>
            <p>
                Recently, you must have heard about some of the events happening in the Middle East, specifically between Israel and Palestine. The conflict has been a significant topic covered in different media for the last couple months, and if you have minimal knowledge about the conflict it can seem difficult to approach - at least that's how I felt. I thought the conflict went back thousands of years because of religious differences, and so I felt that I wouldn't ever be able to grasp the full story of what's going on. If you feel similarly, I think reading this will help tremendously in gaining a historical and recent understanding of the situation.
            </p>
           
            <h1>Glossary</h1>
            <hr>
            <p>
                There is some terminology that is important to know to understand the rest of the blog. I believe it isn’t very important to delve deeper into these terms or groups to understand the overall conflict.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>The Ottoman Empire: During the late 19th century, the current Israeli-Palestinian land was ruled over by the Ottoman Empire. The area inhabited members of the big three religions, with the breakdown being about 87% Muslim, 10% Christian, and 3% Jewish - all living peacefully.</li>
                <li>Zionism: An ideology that supports the re-establishment of a Jewish homeland in the territory defined as the historic Land of Israel.</li>
                <li>An Islamic fundamentalist organization and political party that governs the Gaza Strip and is considered a terrorist organization by many countries.</li>
                <li>Fatah: A major Palestinian political party and the largest faction of the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO).</li>
                <li>Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO): An umbrella organization for several groups that represent the Palestinian people and their national interests.</li>
                <li>Right of Return: The principle or demand that Palestinian refugees and their descendants have the right to return to the homes they were displaced from in what is now Israel.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                With these key concepts in place, let's delve into the history of the conflict, starting from the period of World War I.
            </p>
            <h1>History</h1>
            <hr>
            <h2>Balfour Declaration (1917)</h2>
            <p>
                The Balfour Declaration was a statement by the British Government to announce its support for the establishment of a “national home for the Jewish people '' in Palestine. The main reasons for why the declaration was issued are support of Zionism, World War I strategy, and post-war influence. Some members of the British government, including Balfour himself, were sympathetic to the Zionist cause. They believed in the historical and moral case for supporting Jewish homeland in Palestine. The British were engaged in World War I against the Central Powers, which included the Ottoman Empire that controlled Palestine at the time. They believed that supporting Jewish aspirations could help garner Jewish support for the Allies. The British also saw an opportunity to establish a friendly regime in a strategically important region. Control over Palestine was considered important for protecting the Suez Canal, a vital route to British colonies in Asia, particularly India.
            </p>
            <h2>Arab Revolt (1916 - 1918)</h2>
            <p>
                The Arab Revolt was an uprising against the Ottoman Empire in World War I. The main goal of the revolt was to establish an independent and unified Arab state, which the British government had promised to recognize. The British had made promises to Sharif Hussein through the Hussein-McMahon Correspondence (1915-1916), indicating support for the establishment of an independent Arab state in exchange for Arab support against the Ottomans. However, the exact boundaries and nature of this proposed state were not clearly defined. 
            </p>
            <p>
                The promises of land to both the Jewish and the Arabs laid the groundwork for a long lasting conflict.
            </p>
            <h2>Mandate for Palestine (1920 - 1948)</h2>
            <p>
                The Mandate for Palestine was an arrangement created by the League of Nations after World War I. Essentially, the mandate assigned Britain to oversee the region of Palestine. Britain was responsible for implementing the mandate's terms, which included the establishment of a national home for the Jewish people, as per the Balfour Declaration, while also ensuring that the civil and religious rights of the existing non-Jewish communities in Palestine were not prejudiced. The British facilitated Jewish immigration to Palestine which led to a significant increase in the Jewish population in the area.
            </p>
            <p>
                The mandate was met with strong opposition from the Arab population in Palestine, who viewed it as a violation of their rights to self-determination. The tension between the Jewish and Arab communities over land, political control, and cultural dominance intensified during this period.The mandate period saw increasing conflict between Jews and Arabs, including riots, revolts, and communal violence. The British administration struggled to maintain order and find a political solution acceptable to both sides. 
            </p>
            <p>
                The Holocaust and the plight of Jewish refugees during and after World War II increased international sympathy for the establishment of a Jewish state, leading to further immigration to Palestine.
            </p>
            <p>
                As the conflict escalated, the United Nations proposed a partition plan in 1947, recommending the division of Palestine into separate Jewish and Arab states. The resolution proposed the creation of independent Arab and jewish states and a Special international Regime for the city of Jerusalem and its surroundings. The Arab state was to have a territory of 11,100 square kilometers (42%), the Jewish state a territory of 14,100 square kilometers (56%), while the remaining 2% - comprising the cities of Jerusalem, Bethlehem and the surrounding area - would become an international zone. Jewish organizations collaborated with the United Nations Special Committee on Palestine during the discussions, the Palestinian Arab leadership boycotted it.
            </p>
            <p>
                The proposed plan was considered to have been pro-Zionist by many Palestinian Arabs with 56% of the land allocated to the Jewish state despite the Arab population being about twice the Jewish population. Zionist leaders viewed the acceptance of the plan as a tactical step and a step forward for future expansion of their territory. 
            </p>
            <p>
                The Arab leadership rejected the United Nations Partition Plan on the basis that the Arabs hold a majority in both the population and land ownership. They also indicated an unwillingness to accept any form of territorial division. They announced their intention to take all necessary measures to prevent the implementation of the resolution.
            </p>
            <p>
                With all the conflict around the partition plan, it’s to no surprise that it was not implemented 
            </p>
            <p>
                As the British prepared to end their mandate, Jewish leaders moved towards establishing their own state. On May 14, 1948, just ahead of the official end of the British Mandate, David Ben-Gurion, the head of the Jewish Agency, proclaimed the establishment of the State of Israel. The Declaration of Independence outlined the historical connection of the Jewish people to the land of Israel, referenced the United Nations Partition Plan, and emphasized the establishment of a democratic state - it did not define exact borders or territories.
            </p>
            <h2>Arab-Israeli War (1948 - 1949)</h2>
            <p>
                After the Declaration of the Establishment of the State of Israel, the Arab League decided to intervene by marching their forces into former British Palestine. The fighting led to around 15,000 casualties and resulted in cease-fire agreements. In the aftermath, Israel held much of the former mandate territory, Jordan occupying the West Bank and Egypt taking over the Gaza Strip.
            </p>
            <h2>The Six-Day War (1967)</h2>
            <p>
                The Six-Day War was a conflict involving Israel, Egypt, Jordan, and Syria. After frequent fighting along the borders between Israel and its neighbors, there was significant military buildup, particularly by Egypt and Syria. The unresolved issues for the 1948 Arab-Israeli War and the 1956 Suez Crisis resulted in increased tension among the countries. Israel quickly defeated the Arab forces, gaining control of the Sinai Peninsula and Gaza Strip from Egypt, the West Bank from Jordan, and the Golan Heights from Syria. The war was very short, only lasting six days, and is the beginning of Israel’s occupation of the West Bank and Gaza Strip.
            </p>
            <h2>Peace with Egypt (1978 - 1979)</h2>
            <p>
                The Camp David Accords were a series of negotiations between Israel and Egypt, facilitated by the U.S. President Jimmy Carter. The negotiations led to the signing of a peace treaty in 1979, making Egypt the first Arab country to formally recognize Israel. Israel withdrew from the Sinai Peninsula, which it had occupied since the Six-Day War. 
            </p>
            <h2>Lebanon War (1982)</h2>
            <p>
                After the PLO was expelled from Jordan, the PLO became a more prominent presence in southern Lebanon and used it as a base for attacks against Israel. With Israel security concerns growing, their primary objective in invading Lebanon was to eliminate the PLO’s military capability and reduce the cross-border attacks. The PLO was evicted from Lebanon and moved to Tunisia by Yasser Arafat and the PLO was significantly weakened. 
            </p>
            <h2>The First Intifada (1987 - 1993)</h2>
            <p>
                The first Palestinian uprising was caused by harsh economic conditions, limited social and political freedoms, and general frustration towards the occupation by Israel. The uprising was triggered by an Israeli truck colliding with a Palestinian vehicle, killing four Palestinians. There were widespread protests by the Palestinians with participation from various segments of Palestinian groups. Israel responded with heavy military, leading to significant casualties on the Palestine side. The Intifada drew international attention to the overall conflict, highlighting the conditions under Israeli occupation. 
            </p>
            <h2>Peace with Jordan (1994)</h2>
            <p>
                Israel and Jordan signed a peace treaty in 1994, this was facilitated by the momentum of the Oslo Accords and the earlier peace with Egypt. The treaty resolved relations between the two countries regarding their territorial disputes and security. 
            </p>
            <h2>Oslo Accords & Camp David Summit (1993 - 2000)</h2>
            <p>
                The Oslo Accords involved Israel leader Yitzhak Rabin and PLO leader Yasser Arafat to find a peaceful solution. An important milestone in this process was Arafat’s letter of recognition to Israel’s right to exist. The crux of the agreement was that Israel would gradually cede control of the Palestinian territories over the Palestinians in exchange for peace. The process took a hit with the assassination of Yitzhak Rabin by far right extremist Yigal Amir who opposed the peace initiative. 
            </p>
            <p>
                US President Bill Clinton hosted a peace summit between Arafat and Barak (the new Israel leader). Barak reportedly put the following proposition forward as bases for negotiation: 

            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Territory: Barak offered to withdraw Israeli forces from 91% of the West Bank and 100% of the Gaza Strip.</li>
                <li>Jerusalem: Barak’s proposal included a plan for shared sovereignty in Jerusalem.</li>
                <li>Refugees: The proposal did not grant a full right of return to Israel for Palestinian refugees. It suggested a compensation mechanism and the return of a limited number of refugees based on humanitarian grounds or family reunification. </li>
                <li>Security: The proposal included security arrangements that addressed Israeli concerns, such as the demilitarization of the Palestinian state and Israeli control over key security areas and borders, at least temporarily.</li>
                <li>Statehood: The proposal implicitly acknowledged the creation of a Palestinian state in the territories from which Israel would withdraw.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Arafat rejected this offer, and after Clinton requested that Arafat make a counter-offer - there was no response. No solution was made to satisfy both parties, even after US pressure. 
            </p>
            <h2>Second Intifada (2000 - 2005)</h2>
            <p>
                After several years of unsuccessful negotiations, the conflict reignited during September 2000. The trigger was a visit by Ariel Sharon (leader of Israeli opposition) to the Temple Mount in Jerusalem, a site sacred to both Jews and Muslims. This was seen as a provocative act by the Palestinians. Unlike the First Intifada, this one involved armed attacks and suicide bombings by Palestinians and military operations by Israel. The conflict resulted in a high number of casualties on both sides. Israel began constructing a barrier in the West Bank, which they argued was necessary for security, white Palestinians saw it as an annexation of territory. 
            </p>
            <h2>Fatah-Hamas Split (2006 - 2007)</h2>
            <p>
                Fatah-Hamas Split (2006 - 2007)
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Fatah: A major political party and the largest faction within the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO), traditionally led by Yasser Arafat until his death in 2004. Fatah was seen as more moderate and had been the dominant force in Palestinian politics.</li>
                <li>Hamas: An Islamist organization, founded in 1987, which emerged from the Muslim Brotherhood. It gained popularity for its social welfare programs and resistance against Israel. Hamas is designated as a terrorist organization by several countries, including the United States and the European Union, primarily due to its use of suicide bombings and attacks against Israeli civilians.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                In 2006, Hamas won Palestinian legislative elections. The international community refused to work with a Hamas-led government unless it renounced violence, recognized Israel, and accepted previous arguments. In June 2007, Hamas took control of the Gaza Strip after a brief but intense conflict with Fatah forces. Fatah retained control of the West Bank.
            </p>
            <h2>The Conflict Today (2023)</h2>
            <p>
                On October 7, 2023, Hamas launched a surprise attack on Israel, leading to a spike in violence. At least 10,000 Palestinians and 1,400 Israelis have been killed.
            </p>
            <h1>Analysis</h1>
            <hr>
                If you are reading this to gain a historical understanding of the conflict to see how this all started, then you can stop reading here. The next section is going to be about my personal thoughts and prescriptive claims on moving forward. 
            </p>
            <h2>The Conditions under Israel’s Occupation</h2>
            <p class="source">https://www.amnesty.org/en/location/middle-east-and-north-africa/israel-and-occupied-palestinian-territories/report-israel-and-occupied-palestinian-territories/</p>
            <p>
                Israeli forces have been involved in regular open fire at unarmed Palestinians in the West Bank and East Jerusalem. 2022 was the deadliest year for Palestinians in these areas since 2006, but the death toll in 2023 has already passed the 2022 numbers. 
            </p>
            <p>
                I believe it was possible to have an occupation over Gaza and the West Bank while maintaining a decent quality of life. The growing amnesty the Palestinains felt leading up to the First Intifada came directly from Israel’s imposed conditions. The occupation conditions may have been a big factor in Hamas winning the election in 2006, causing major international opposition to Palestines.
            </p>
            <h2>Israel’s Disproportionate Responses</h2>
            <p class="source">https://www.aljazeera.com/news/liveblog/2023/12/20/israel-hamas-war-live-israel-kills-around-100-palestinians-in-one-day?update=2570008</p>
            <p class="source">https://www.aljazeera.com/news/longform/2023/10/9/israel-hamas-war-in-maps-and-charts-live-tracker</p>
            <p>
                The Palestinians have fought back Israel multiple times as you have seen, and Israel’s responses have been severely disproportionate in terms of the death count.  
            </p>
            <p>
                If we take the First Intifada for example, the Israeli army killed at least 1,087 Palestinians. On the Israeli side, the total deaths included around 100 civilians and 60 Israeli soldiers. In the most recent conflict, there have been at least 20,000 deaths on the Palestinian side and nearly 1,200 on the Israeli side. 
            </p>
            <p>
                However, I believe there is some nuance to HOW Israel can respond. Palestinians typically attack from civilian areas, they do not have a centralized military outpost. If Israel wants to attack Hamas from where Hamas is attacking from, civilian casualties are unavoidable - Hamas is essentially using human shields. At least in the recent conflict, I think we need more insight into the IDF’s intel/process to prove they are being malicious in killing civilians. 
            </p>
            <p>
                I am against the idea that Israel is actively trying to genocide the Palestinians. Israel has been more involved than Palestine in the peace processes in the past and successfully negotiated peace treaties with Egypt and Jordan. Additionally, their response to Gaza and the West Bank are very different because the majority of the attacks are coming out of Gaza, resulting in a harsher response towards Gaza. If they were truly trying to commit genocide, they would respond the same way to both areas with the goal to kill as many as possible. This behavior does not support the idea that Israel wants to genocide the Palestinian population.

            <h2>The Palestinians Support for Hamas</h2>

                I can understand the Palestinians desire to fight back against Israel because of the occupation and wars in the past. I still disagree with the Palestinians behavior during the Camp David Summit and I understand why Hamas was elected.

                However, the Palestinian people need to push against the Hamas ideology. The support for Hamas in the West Bank has increased from 12% to 44% and in the Gaza Strip from 38% to 42%. The thing that lost them major international support in the first place is the same thing gaining support right now. I believe this is a step in the wrong direction, Israel’s military and ally support is too strong for Palestine to fight back against. Palestine needs to win back some international support to really help their people, if Israel were to ceasefire right now, Hamas would go and launch another attack. Palestinian support should not mean Hamas support - which is something that gets lost in the left leaning support in the west.

                The two state solution is most likely the only viable solution forward. If it is possible to get the Camp David proposal again, it should be pursued. Intense international pressure from the U.S, Russia, etc. is needed to get both countries to the table. The countries currently supporting Palestine's military effort need to be stopped, the military pushback against Israel is only hurting themselves. I hope this piece was informative and helped readers gain an understanding of the conflict. I understand if you disagree with my analysis - this is a complex issue and I can’t claim to know everything about it. This is a collection of my research and the conclusions I have reached, if you do have disagreements I encourage you to email me to discuss - I would love to learn more.
